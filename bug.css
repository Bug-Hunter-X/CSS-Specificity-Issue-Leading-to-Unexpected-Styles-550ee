The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

This might seem straightforward, but the rendered output depends on the HTML structure. If a `<p>` element is nested within a `<div>`, the selector `div p` will override the selector `p` due to its higher specificity. However, if there's a `<p>` element outside any `<div>`, it will be styled with red because of the less specific selector `p`.

This is not necessarily an error, but it demonstrates how specificity can create unexpected results if not carefully considered.  A lack of understanding of CSS specificity can lead to many frustrating bugs.
